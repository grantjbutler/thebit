### Setup

To setup thebit you'll need to run `npm install` in the directory you clone the repo to. Afterwards you'll need to create a copy of the config files. Based on what controllers you use this may include a `.env` with environment variables with details for ATEM or OBS connections as seen below.
```shell
ATEM_IP_ADDRESS=192.168.0.XXX
OBS_WS_ADDRESS=192.168.0.XXX
OBS_WS_PASSWORD=<passwordGeneratedByOBS>
```

You can copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your details to get started.
```shell
cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

Afterwards you'll need to do something similar for the `config.yaml` file.

### Listeners
Listeners are defined in the `config.yaml` file under the `listeners` key. Inside you can define a listener type (currently Socket.IO or a WebSocket). Additionally you define an array of rules for the listener to apply to it's defined controller. Rules contain a `script` key that should be a javascript script that returns a `ListenerAction`.

For example, for an OBS Controller, if you were listening for the message `donation:show` from a Socket.IO server this would run the `shrink` action on scene `player1` with a magnitude of `0.5`.
```yaml
rules:
    - on: "donation:show"
      script: |
        (() => {
            return {action: "shrink", path: "player1", magnitude: 0.5}
        })()
```

To address instances where you could potentially recieve duplicates of a message, listeners implement a history of 100 unique id's. Unique ID's must be provided by the server we are listening to and you can identify what value in the event can be used as such by returning a "uid" key in your script as part of the returned `ListenerAction`. +

### Development

When developing you can use `npm run dev` to run with nodemon to automatically
reload as you make changes to the files.

For testing WSListeners you can use `node scripts/wsserver.js`, just ensure your `.env` has a `WS_ADDRESS` set in it like so
```shell
WS_ADDRESS=ws://localhost:8080
```

You can then send test messages via like so
```
./scripts/test.sh send amount 10.00 donationid abc123 event donation:show
```

The `test.sh` script has a few odd commands in it but the most important is `send` which lets you send a simple JSON formatted message over the server created via `wsserver.js`. This requires having `websocat` and `js` available on your machine.


### Production

To run this in a production capacity you'll need to run it with `npm run start`.
